  "summary": "The diff largely implements a new government-jobs UI on /jobs (royal-blue styling, emblem header, React Query caching, search/category filtering, load-more pagination, and official-domain allowlisting for apply links). However, several BuildRequest acceptance criteria are not fully met based on the provided diff summary/truncation: data sourcing is still a curated static dataset (not RSS/API/back-end aggregated), missing-field placeholders (“—”) are not rendered (fields are conditionally hidden), required footer disclaimer text is not evidenced, the required phone number is not evidenced, and the required generated emblem asset file is not shown as added.",

      "requirement": "Implement a government-jobs data source (RSS feeds/public APIs) replacing Remotive integration, normalized into a single job list; include caching/refresh behavior.",
      "reason": "The new client explicitly states it uses a curated static dataset because RSS requires CORS proxies; there is no evidence of RSS/API integration or backend aggregation/caching. Requirement is marked [both] but no backend changes are shown.",

      "reason": "JobCard only renders vacancies/qualification/lastDate/location blocks when the fields exist (e.g., `{job.vacancies && (...)}`), which hides missing fields rather than showing a placeholder “—”.",

      "reason": "Footer shows contact info from `cafeInfo` and a WhatsApp link, but the exact disclaimer text is not present in the shown snippet, and the required phone number 9435212145 is not evidenced (config summary mentions updated WhatsApp/email, not phone).",
